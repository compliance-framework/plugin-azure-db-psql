## Building the plugin

```sh
mkdir -p dist
go build -o dist/plugin main.go
```

## Data structure passed to the policy manager

The plugin passes the raw structures provided by the Azure Go SDK for PostgreSQL Flexible Servers to the policy manager. These can be queried directly in Rego policies. The plugin also enriches the data with additional labels and context for compliance assessment.

The main Go type passed to the policy manager is: `armpostgresqlflexibleservers.Server`

For details on available fields, refer to the [Azure SDK documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/resourcemanager/postgresql/armpostgresqlflexibleservers#Server).

To see the data in action, review the unit tests in the [policies repo](https://github.com/compliance-framework/plugin-azure-db-psql-policies/tree/main/policies).
